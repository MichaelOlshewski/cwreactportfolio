This homework's task was to create an application that you can add any burger that would like to eat and keep track of any that you have ate already. I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Handlebars for the front-end, and utilized Express, Express-Router, MySQL, a custom ORM and Node.JS with Nodemon. This application was built completely from scratch from building the basic html pages to setting up the server, route handling, setting up the MVC, and handling CRUD events to and from the MySQL database and finally uploading on Heroku.",
